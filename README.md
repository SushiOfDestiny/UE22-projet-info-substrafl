### Project Overview
This project was done during first year at Mines Paris School. Goal is to implement the option to use TensorFlow objects instead of Torch ones in the basic features of the federated learning in the SubstraFL framework developed by Owkin.

### Substra
Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It enables the training and validation of machine learning models on distributed datasets. It provides a flexible Python interface and a web application to run federated learning training at scale. This specific repository is about SubstraFL the high-level federated learning Python library based on the low-level [Substra](https://github.com/Substra/substra) python library. SubstraFL is used to run complex federated learning experiments at scale.
